# Christian Media App

## Overview

The Christian Media App is a web application designed to provide a platform for sharing and accessing Christian content such as sermons, 
worship music, articles, and other faith-based resources. The app offers users the ability to register, log in, and interact with various types of content.
Future features will include commenting, liking, and sharing videos similar to social media platforms like Facebook.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to access personalized content.
- **Content Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for different types of content, such as sermons, articles, and videos.
- **Category-Based Browsing**: Users can filter and browse content by categories.
- **User Profiles**: Registered users have profiles that display their interactions, such as comments and liked content.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive across different devices.

## Technical Overview

### Backend

- **Framework**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Security**: Spring Security with JWT for authentication and authorization.
- **Database**: Hibernate ORM with JPA for database interaction, handling entities like `User`, `Content`, `Category`, `Comment`, and `Member`.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs to manage users, content, comments, and categories.

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.
- **State Management**: React Hooks and Context API for managing state and props.
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side routing.

### Deployment

- **Servers**: The backend and frontend are hosted on separate servers, with CORS enabled to handle cross-origin requests.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Serialization and ORM**: Gained hands-on experience with JSON serialization and ORM techniques using Hibernate, including managing bidirectional
- relationships with annotations like `@JsonIgnoreProperties`, `@JsonBackReference`, and `@JsonManagedReference`.
- **Spring Security**: Configured and implemented JWT-based security, managing custom filters for token generation and validation.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Addressed CORS issues and effectively integrated a React frontend with a Spring Boot backend.

## Future Enhancements

- **Social Features**: Implement commenting, liking, and sharing features similar to Facebook to enhance user interaction with content.
- **Notification System**: Add real-time notifications for new content, comments, and interactions.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a native mobile application for iOS and Android platforms.
- **Advanced Search**: Implement a more advanced search feature with filters and sorting options.
